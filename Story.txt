Once upon a time, in a land far far away, Dr. Mehlhase was stranded on top of Schloss Eltz.
Dr. Mehlhase's only companion was her hund named Swartz. 
Luckily, she was able to go down to her Ratskeller so she did not starve.
At the Ratskeller she would always order her favorite dessert, apfelkuchen.
For Dr. Mehlhase's hund she would order a bratwurst, later in the night Swartz disappeared.
Dr. Mehlhase heard a engine start, turns out Swartz found a Porsche bit into the wheel causing the Porche to start its engine.
That is when a BMW pulled up with a fesh paint
The driver of that vehicle was none other than Dr.Mehlhase's hund.
The two decide to go visit a popular baeckerei in Raesfeld.
At this backerei, they ate some gebaeck along with some doeners.
Unfortunately the Klimaanlage in the backerei was too powerful, and it froze them into blocks of ice.
